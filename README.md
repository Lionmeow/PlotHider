With the 0.4 update, gadgets were given the ability to be placed anywhere. But because plots exist, they can't truly be placed ANYWHERE. If you'd rather fill an area with decoration or utility than with a corral, this mod lets you do that.

Interact with the plot's button in gadget mode in order to hide it.\
Interact with the floating gear to show it again.

This mod is built via [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/) and thus requires it to work.
